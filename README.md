# Cardano Components Documentation

Welcome to our collection of walkthroughs and explainers of the Cardano API and related components! This body of work, while not comprehensive, is intended as quick-and-easy overview of the Cardano blockchain essentials for new developers.

Moreover, these documents are part of [MLabs'](https://www.mlabs-digital.com/) Developer Documentation Drive project. This project was generously generously supported and funded by the Cardano community through [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/). Its original Fund9 grant proposal can be viewed [here](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/64396). The documentation of several other ecosystem projects were also improved as part of this initiative, in particular:

* [Plutarch](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus) - A typed eDSL for writing UPLC
* [Cardano-Transaction-Library](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib) - A Purescript library for building Cardano smart contract transactions
* [Plutip](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip) - A Cardano testing tool for spawning local clusters
* [Oura](https://github.com/txpipe/oura) - A pipeline tool for filtering Cardano blockchain events
* [Scrolls](https://github.com/txpipe/scrolls) - A read-optimized cache of Cardano on-chain entities

## Version Notes

These particular documents were originally penned by [pb99u069](https://github.com/pb99u069) as part of work on this proposal. It is forked and recollected here for easier discoverability, organization, and transparency. As of writing, the author hosts a [GitHub Pages instance](https://pb99u069.github.io/) which some readers may prefer. Finally, as part of Project Catalyst fund compliance, regular progress reports which document the history of our Developer Documentation Drive project are pubicly available through Project Catalyst channels and reproduced [here](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/catalyst-funded-projects/tree/main/Fund9/Dev%20Documentation%20Drive).
