# Cardano Components Documentation

Welcome to our collection of walkthroughs and explainers of the Cardano API and related components! This body of work, while not comprehensive, is intended as a quick-and-easy overview of Cardano blockchain essentials for new developers.

Moreover, these documents are part of [MLabs'](https://www.mlabs-digital.com/) Developer Documentation Drive project. This project was generously supported and funded by the Cardano community through [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/), and its original Fund9 grant proposal can be viewed [here](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/64396). The documentation of several other ecosystem projects was also improved as part of this initiative, in particular:

* [Plutarch](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch-plutus) - A typed eDSL for writing UPLC
* [Cardano-Transaction-Library](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib) - A Purescript library for building Cardano smart contract transactions
* [Plutip](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip) - A Cardano testing tool for spawning local clusters
* [Oura](https://github.com/txpipe/oura) - A pipeline tool for filtering Cardano blockchain events
* [Scrolls](https://github.com/txpipe/scrolls) - A read-optimized cache of Cardano on-chain entities

## Version Notes

The documentation herein was originally written by [pb99u069](https://github.com/pb99u069) as part of this Fund9 proposal. The original repo was forked and its contents collected here for greater discoverability, organization, and transparency. As of writing, the author hosts a [GitHub Pages instance](https://pb99u069.github.io/) which some readers may prefer. Finally, as part of Project Catalyst fund compliance, regular progress reports documenting the history of our Developer Documentation Drive project are publicly available through Project Catalyst channels and reproduced [here](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/catalyst-funded-projects/tree/main/Fund9/Dev%20Documentation%20Drive).
